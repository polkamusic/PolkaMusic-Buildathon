# The problem PolkaMusic solves

PolkaMusic NFT Rewards gamifies the music streaming experience on PolkaMusic decentralized streaming platform. This is an extension to the PolkaMusic project that we have been building for few months.

PolkaMusic is a DDEX compatible substrate-based public chain that is being crafted exclusively for operating decentralized music businesses on the blockchain. While PolkaMusic.io is a decentralized streaming platform by itself, it is envisioned as a 360 infrastructure for decentralized music using which music entrepreneurs can not only create their own micro-economy for their music platform but also leverage the ever-growing list of features such as NFT, crowdfunding, decentralized storage and more. PolkaMusic also allows existing music blockchains to connect to the PolkaMusic ecosystem in order to interconnect siloed music economies and enable interoperability, wherever possible.

PolkaMusic is trying to solve 4 major problems that are unique to the music industry:
Pro-Rata Royalty Payment Model, Lack of transparency, Digital blind spots and Slow processing.
